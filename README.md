- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some CSS code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.card {
  width: 320px;
  height: 100%;
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.082);
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  margin: auto;
  margin-top: 8%;
  padding: 16px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
```
```css
body {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  font-size: 16px;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development

Looking ahead to future projects, my main objective is to ensure proper scaling of the card, which would enable the contents to be aligned centrally irrespective of the device it is viewed on. This is a crucial aspect that I would like to prioritize in my work going forward, as it guarantees a seamless viewing experience and enhances user engagement.
